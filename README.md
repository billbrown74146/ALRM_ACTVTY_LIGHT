# ALRM_ACTVTY_LIGHT

A RGB LED light strip indicator for car alarms

Im making an Arduino based controller to run a cool looking RGB LED strip that will
indicate the condition of a car's alarm status.  When armed it will have a red back 
and forth "CYLON" effect and when unarmed the color will change to green and be much
slower. Other conditions such as door pin status, shock sensor input and whether the
alarm has been tripped since it was last armed will be added in future revisions.
